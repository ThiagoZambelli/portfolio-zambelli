    "Welcome to my 'thiago-container'! My name is Thiago Zambelli, Web Developer. Here I'll show you everything I know and what I'm learning, besides leaving knowledge for other people. I sincerely hope I can help you and maybe teach you something new :)",
    "If I were to sum myself up in one short phrase, I think it would be 'Creative Restlessness'. I literally love learning about absolutely everything: literature; astronomy; mathematics; religion; anthropology; biology; electronics, cooking; how many sticks make a canoe, etc! And this has given me a framework of knowledge and skills that form my self.",
    "I use my facility to acquire knowledge and turn it into something useful, to have as my greatest hobby personal evolution. I have written short stories and novels, I have done various types of fights, I have done the foundation and the electrical network of a house, I have cooked the most diverse dishes, etc.",
    "But my true love has always been technology. I have long dreamed of being a programmer and did a lot of things to prepare for it, including my 8 years in the military (from which I left with a letter of honor) that served to fund my academic training.",
    "What I can say is: I may not be the best programmer in the world yet, but I will give absolutely every last drop of sweat to be !"
